### Name:

John Smith

### Contacts:

@ahayuta in rs-school discord server.

### Info:

20 years old, Saint Petersburg, Russia. My goal is to become a frontend developer. I am always glad to learn new things in different areas of our universe.

### Skills:

Average level - html, css, flexbox css, git, sass, figma. Low level - js, css grid.

### Code example:

**Task**: The input is a three-digit integer number, and then a digit. Print true if this digit is the average of the number (tens place), and false if not. If the entered number is not three-digit, print "error".
**Code**:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

class Example {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int a = sc.nextInt();
int b = sc.nextInt();
if (a < 0) {a _= -1;}
if (b < 0) {b _= -1;}
String x = Integer.toString(a);
String y = Integer.toString(b);
char a1 = x.charAt(1);
char a2 = y.charAt(0);
int f = a1;
int g = a2;
if (a < 100 || a > 999) {
System.out.println("error");
} else if (f == g) {
System.out.println("true");
} else System.out.println("false");
}
}
```
### Experience:

Tour-plan site: https://github.com/ahayuta/tour-plan. In addition to this project, I have a few more, but they are still too sloppy to show them.

### Education:

Self-study on the Internet. Lots of different videos and articles. And if we talk about my university education, then I specialize in the study of religion :).

### English:

It so happened that I can understand and read quite well in English, but itâ€™s still hard for me to speak it. Therefore, I would say that the level of proficiency is average.
